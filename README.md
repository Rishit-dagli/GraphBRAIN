# GraphBRAIN

The blood-brain barrier is a protective layer that separates the brain from the rest of the body‚Äôs circulatory system. This barrier is highly selective and prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside.

To be effective as therapeutic agents, centrally-acting drugs (central to the brain) must cross the blood-brain barrier. Conversely, to be devoid of unwanted central nervous system effects, peripherally acting drugs (peripherally to the brain) must show limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In both cases, the blood-brain barrier permeability of drug candidates must be known. However, the experimental determination of brain-blood partitioning is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive and not suitable to screen large collections of chemicals. A broadly applicable method for predicting the blood$-$brain barrier permeation of candidates at an early stage of discovery would have a great impact on drug research and development.

Thus we built GraphBRAIN to solve this power using the power of graphs and Machine Learning.
